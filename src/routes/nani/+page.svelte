			Jua Board is a daily message board based on network effects and speculation. Any verified user
			can submit one <i>bid</i> for the next day's message. A verified user can also submit one
			<i>wager</i> for the next day's message. A wager is a prediction of what the next day's message
			will be. Messages are limited to 40 characters.

			At the end of the day at 00:00 UTC, a raffle takes place to determine the new daily message.
			The new selected message is compared with all submitted wagers, and each user is assigned a
			score based on the strength of their prediction. These scores are factored into the next day's
			raffle.

			All users' bids are assigned a score based on their wagers from the previous raffle. If a user
			did not submit a wager on the previous day, their current bid is assigned an average score. The
			winning bid is selected from a weighted random function. <b
